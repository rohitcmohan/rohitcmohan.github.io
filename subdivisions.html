					<h3>Roles of Pleiades at NASA</h3>
					<p>
						Pleiades is part of NASA’s <b>High-End Computing Capability (HECC)</b> Project and represents NASA’s state-of-the-art technology for meeting the agency’s supercomputing requirements,
						enabling NASA scientists and engineers to conduct high-fidelity modeling and simulation for NASA missions in Earth studies, space science, aeronautics research, as well as human and
						robotic space exploration.<br>
						Some of the scientific and engineering projects run on Pleiades include:

							<h3>The Kepler Mission</h3>
							<p>
								<b>Kepler</b> is a space observatory launched by NASA to discover Earth-size planets orbiting other stars. It monitors a section of space containing more than 200,000 stars and takes
								high-resolution images every 30 minutes. After the operations center gathers this data, it is pipelined to Pleiades in order to calculate the size, orbit, and location of the planets
								surrounding these stars.<br> As of February 2012, the Kepler mission has discovered 1,235 planets, 5 of which are approximately Earth-sized and orbit within the "habitable zone" where
								water can exist in all three forms (solid, liquid, gas).

							<h3>CFD Modelling</h3>
							<p>
								Research and development of next generation space launch vehicles is done on Pleiades using cutting-edge analysis tools and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and simulation in
								order to create more efficient and affordable space launch system and vehicle designs.

							<h3>Astrophysics Research</h3>
							<p>
								Astrophysics research into the formation of galaxies is run on Pleiades to create simulations of how our own Milky Way Galaxy was formed and what forces might have caused it to form in
								its signature disk-shape. Pleiades has also been the supercomputing resource for dark matter research and simulation, helping to discover gravitationally bound “clumps” of dark matter
								within galaxies in one of the largest simulations ever done, in terms of particle numbers.
