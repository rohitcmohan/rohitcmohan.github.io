				<h3>Pleiades</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Pleiades</b> is a petascale supercomputer housed at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) facility at NASA Ames Research Center located at Moffett Field near Mountain View, California.
					It is maintained by NASA and partners Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Intel.

				<h3>Pleiades Performance Figures</h3>
				<p>
					As of November 2015 it is ranked the world's thirteenth-fastest computer on the TOP500 list with a LINPACK rating of 4.09 petaflops (4.09 quadrillion floating point operations per second)
					and a peak performance of 5.35 petaflops following a large hardware upgrade.<br> The ultimate goal of the partnership between NASA and SGI is to attain a peak supercomputing performance of
					10 petaflops, or 10 quadrillion floating point operations per second, in order to "increase the computational capabilities for research, [and] modeling and simulation work at the NASA Advanced
					Supercomputing (NAS) facility.

				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>
					Built in 2008 and named for the Pleiades open star cluster, the supercomputer debuted as the third most powerful supercomputer in the world at 487 teraflops.
					It originally contained 100 SGI Altix ICE 8200EX racks with 12,800 Intel Xeon quad-core E5472 Harpertown processors connected with more than 20 miles of InfiniBand double data rate (DDR) cabling.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the addition of ten more racks of quad-core X5570 Nehalem processors in 2009, Pleiades ranked sixth on the November 2009 TOP500 with 14,080 processors running at 544 teraflops.<br>
					In January 2010, the scientists and engineers at NAS successfully completed a “live integration” of another ICE 8200 rack by connecting the new rack’s InfiniBand dual port fabric via 44
					fibre cables while the supercomputer was still running a full workload, saving 2 million hours in productivity that would otherwise have been lost.<br>
					In subsequent years, the system was updated as and when newer intel upgrades were out. In the latest addition in January 2015, additional Haswell nodes were installed and released to users,
					giving Pleiades a new peak theoretical processing capacity of 5.35 petaflops.
